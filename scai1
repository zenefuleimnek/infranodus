Ownersofaweb-siteareofteninterestedinanalysisofgroups of users of their site. Information on these groups can help optimizing the structure and contents of the site. In this paper we use an approach based on formal concepts for constructing taxonomies of user groups. For decreasing the huge amount of concepts that arise in applications, we employ stability index of a concept, which describes how a group given by a concept extent differs from other such groups. We analyze resulting taxonomies of user groups for three target websites.
Since the Turing test was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, the primary goal of artificial intelligence has been predicated on the ability for computers to imitate human behavior. However, the majority of uses for the computer can be said to fall outside the domain of human abilities and it is exactly outside of this domain where computers have demonstrated their greatest contribution to intelligence. Another goal for artificial intelligence is one that is not predicated on human mimicry, but instead, on human amplification. This article surveys various systems that contribute to the advancement of human and social intelligence.
